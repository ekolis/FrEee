This is a C# port of the excellent libfixmath library, which can currently be found at http://code.google.com/p/libfixmath/

It implements a fixed-point 16.16 numeric type and transcendent operations on it (square root, trig, etc).

It is covered by unit tests, most of which are also ported from libfixmath.
