Description
  General description for this mount.

Code
  Code letter displayed on a component to show the mount being used. 

Cost Percent
  Percentage modifier to the cost of the component (in all resource types).

Tonnage Percent
  Percentage modifier to the tonnage size of the component.

Tonnage Structure Percent      
  Percentage modifier to the tonnage structure of the component.

  Percentage modifier to the damage that this weapon component does at all ranges.

Shield Percent (Optional)
  Percentage modifier to the shields generated by this component.

Supply Percent
  Percentage modifier to the amount of supplies that this component uses.

Range Modifier
  + or - modifier to the range of this weapon. For example, if this is 4, then the
  damage the weapon does at range will be extended by 4. So at a range of 4,
  this weapon will do as much damage as the weapon normally does at range 0. 

Weapon To Hit Modifier
  + or - modifier to the to hit chance of this weapon.

  A comma separated list of the component families which can use this mount. 
  If this field is not present, then all families can use this mount. 

Weapon Type Requirement
  The component must be of this weapon type.
  Any - Any Weapon Type
  None - Non Weapon Types Only
  Direct Fire, Seeking, Point-Defense, Warhead

Vehicle Type
  The mount can only be used on this vehicle type. 
  Any, Ship, Base, Fighter, Satellite, Mine, Troop, Weapon Platform, Drone

Number of Tech Req: (Optional)
  The number of Tech Requirements that are for this enhancement. The Tech requirement
  determines the technology level an empire must have before this enhancement
  becomes visible to be used in designs.

Tech Area Req X:    (Optional)
  For each of the Tech Requirements, this is the tech area of the requirement.
  The X is the number of the requirement.
  Allowable values for Tech Area Req:
    A name from the TechArea.txt file.

Tech Level Req X:   (Optional)
  For each of the Tech Requirements, this is the tech level in the given area
  that must be reached.
  The X is the number of the requirement.
  Allowable values for Tech Level Req:
    A value from 1 to the Maximum Level for this Tech Area as defined in the
    TechArea.txt file.
