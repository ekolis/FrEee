TECH AREA DATA FILE
=======================================================================================

Name: 
  Name of the technology

Group:
  The group name this technology will be under. Any group name can be used.

Description:
  Description of the technology.

Maximum Level:
  The maximum level of this tech area that can be achieved.

Level Cost:
  The cost to increase one level in this tech area. The cost increases by
  the game setup factor as the levels get higher.

Start Level:
  The level at which the player starts the game.
  The 3 colonization tech areas are a special case which the game will set
  higher based on your racial traits.

Raise Level:
  If a medium level of technology is chosen in the game setup, then this level
  is the starting level for each player (if the Start Level is higher than this
  value, the Start Level is used).

Racial Area:
  This is a user-defined number which is connected to the Racial Traits. Some
  Racial Traits allow for certain tech areas to be available. If this number
  is greater than zero, then this technology area will only be shown to the
  player if they have the racial trait with the corresponding Racial Area id.
  Current Values are:
    1 - Psychic
    2 - Deeply Religious
    3 - Temporal Knowledge
    4 - Crystallurgy
    5 - Organic Manipulation

Unique Area:
  This is a user-defined number which is connected to certain abilities such
  as Ancient Ruins Unique. Some abilities will cause a unique tech to become
  available. If this number is greater than zero, then this technology area 
  will only be shown to the player if they have the attained\activated the
  ability with the corresponding Unique Area id.

Can Be Removed:
  Whether this tech area can be un-selected for use in the game. Be careful
  that you do not allow a required tech to be removed from the game. 

Number of Tech Req:
  This is the number of other tech areas that are required to be completed 
  before this one will be displayed. 

Tech Area Req #, Tech Level Req #:
  The tech area and level required.
