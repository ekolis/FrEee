INSTALLING THE DESIGN NAME PACK
===============================

(1) Unzip the files using the "All Files option (i.e. the default settings for winzip) into the \[Space Empires IV]\Dsgnname subdirectory or a mod directory of your choosing, provided they are placed in a \Dsgnname subdirectory.  This will place all the new files in the appropriate subdirecty.

(2) That's it!  When you "edit" your race at the start of the game, the additional design name files should be available for use.
