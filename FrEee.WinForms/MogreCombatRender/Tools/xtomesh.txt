Tools:

DeleD
Deled Ogre Mesh exporter plugin
xtomesh ahk script.
possibly:
Notepad++
batch image filetype conversion tool of some sort (I have an excelent one installed, that shows up when you right click multiple selected images, I can't figure out the name or where it came from, or where it's even runing from though)

if the shipset you're wanting to convert is not using bmp files, then the process is very simple.

ensure you've installed DeleD and the DeleD Ogre mesh exporter plugin. 
launch xtomesh 
it will ask you for the location of the DeleD.exe (giving it that shortcut on your desktop is also fine)
it will then ask for the import folder - this is the SEV shipset folder with the .x files in it.
it will then ask for an export folder - give it an empty folder, or create one.

xtomesh script will zip through each of the .x files in the import folder and turn them into .mesh and .material files.
now do some slightly tedious work of creating a .cfg file for each of the hulltypes. 
if you don't want to bother with effects then just a cfg file with the meshname entry should be fine.

if the shipset uses .bmp files for the ship textures, you may get an error from DeleD saying that an xxxx bit bmp is not suported.
in this case, use a tool to convert the .bmp files to .png files. (make a copy the shipset folder out of the seV dir if you've not done so already)
then open up notepad++ and ensure you have no open files (notepad++ will reopen any files you left open in it last time you closed it)
select all the .x files in the import folder, rightclick and edit with notepad++
do a find and replace ".bmp" to ".png" in all open files.
re-run the xtomesh script.


 
notes on the cfg files:

how to set the thruster locations:
open the .x file in DeleD
mouse over the location of the thruster port, note down the x, y and z location of the cursor (it'll say two of the locations in the titlebar of the active subwindow, switch to another view to get the third) 
Here's an example with some comments (the actual file shoudl not have comments, there's no commenting in JSON files unfortunatly)

{
    "MainMesh": {			
        "Name" : "Imp_LtCruiser.mesh",
        "Scale" : [1,1,1]
    },

        "ForwardThrust_Effect": {
            "Left": {				//each of these sub objects under "FowardThruster_Effect" can have any string as name, ie left, center, right. the names *must* be uneque to this sub though.
                "ParticleEffect": "Thruster",	//"Thruster" here is the name of the particle effect. note that this is not the filename of the particle effect, but the particle_system Name. open the particle effect up in an text editor and you can find the name. 
                "Loc": [ -330, -520, 65],	//location of the effect as explained above using DeleD
                "Dir": [0, -1, 0 ]		//the direction that the effect will face. ie, [0,-1,0] is backwards
