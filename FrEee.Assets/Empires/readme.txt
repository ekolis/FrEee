The Empires folder contains any saved empire files that players create when setting up games.
These files store information about the player's empire, including its name, colors, racial traits, and other settings.
When a player creates a new empire in the game, they can customize various aspects of their empire and then save it to this folder. The saved empire files can be loaded later when starting a new game, allowing players to quickly select and reuse their preferred empire without having to reconfigure its settings each time they play.
These empire files also need to be sent to the game host in multiplayer games so that the host can set up the game with all players' empires included.
