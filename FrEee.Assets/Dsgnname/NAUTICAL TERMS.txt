 Peso ( Piece of Eight ) - The peso was the main coin in the Spanish-American colonies. It was slightly larger than the 19th century U.S. silver dollar. It had a value of eight reales.

 Treasure Map - Once again this is a fictional device dreamed up by authors. Pirates did not bury their loot. It probably came about after Captain Kidd's capture as he was purported to have seized more booty than was found with him. The populace found that the burial rumour was a plausible explanation for the lack of booty and the burial theory has been with us ever since. 

 Walk the Plank - Walking the Plank referrred to blindfolding a prisoner, tying his hands to his sides, and forcing him to walk a plank that was suspended out over the sea.
