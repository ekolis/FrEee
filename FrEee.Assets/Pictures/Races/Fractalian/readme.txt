README FILE FOR FRACTALIAN RACE STYLE FOR SPACE EMPIRES IV
----------------------------------------------------------

Installation
------------
Thanks for downloading my SE4 race style! To use it in your game, simply place all the *.BMP files and the FRACTALIAN_AI_*.TXT files into a folder named Fractalian in the Pictures folder in your SE4 folder. Then, place the ELEMENTS.TXT file into the Dsgnname folder in your SE4 folder. The Fractalian race should now be available in your games.

About this race style
---------------------
I created this style with an unregistered version of Moray (bad bad boy!), deciding on a geometrically oriented race since it would be easy to do. (I'd previously done an attempt at a Borg shipset; that might be floating around somewhere, but the AI files aren't all there, but what the hey, pretty much all I did for this one was copy the AI from one of the existing races since I've heard they're all the same anyway!)

This race style is copyright 2000 Ed Kolis. Space Empires IV is copyright 1997-2000 Malfador Machinations and Shrapnel Games. Or something like that. You can use this race style in your games (duh! that's what it's for!); all I ask is that you include this readme file, and the ELEMENTS.TXT design names file, and also that you refrain from using this style as your style on any of the major SE4 communities and tournament grounds such as the Borg Collective and SE4 Universal Community. Why's that? Well, because it's my style and I'd like to reserve the right to use it in those communities. Maybe that will change at some future point in time (say, if SE4 fans everywhere get into a big uproar that I'm being so protective of my work), but that's it for now.

(4-24-2001: OK, I changed my mind, use this pic set whenever you want, even in online multiplayer games! I don't care, I don't like playing the same race over and over again, it gets dull!)

Additional notes
----------------
Maybe it's just me, but to all you Red Dwarf fans out there, doesn't the Toltayan's Medium Transport look just a bit familiar? Dum dada dum, dada dum! DADADADA DUM!

(4-24-2001: Also, the AI fil;es are a bit outdated; I think they're only updated to version 1.30)
