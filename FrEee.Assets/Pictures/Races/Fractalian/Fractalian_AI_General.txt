Name                                     := Fractalian
Description                              := A crystalline race with fractal form, the Fractalians are a highly mathematical, yet somewhat impulsive, people.

Emperor Title                            := High Master
Biological Description                   := The Fractalians are crystalline entities which grow to a height of about 1.5 meters and a mass of about 110 kilograms. Their structure is treelike in nature, consisting of a central crystal with smaller crystal projections, which in turn have still smaller projections. The Fractalians evolved on a rocky world with no atmosphere. Having no air to make sound waves in, and having no psychic abilities, the Fractalians instead communicate through vibrations in the ground. Individual Fractalians live for approximately 130 years.
Society Description                      := The Fractalians are ruled by a High Master who controls nearly every aspect of their life. This Master's duties are especially concerned with scientific research, as all Fractalians find mathematics a thing of great beauty.
General History Description              := The Fractalians have tended to be a peaceful people, although they have become violent when provoked, or when the High Master decided that scientific knowledge was at stake and launched a crusade to obtain or defend it. Wars involving the Fractalians, whether internal or external, have tended to be short because of the race's deadly crystalline weapons.
