  Any, Ship, Base, Fighter, Satellite, Mine, Troop, Weapon Platform, Drone

Number of Tech Req: (Optional)
  The number of Tech Requirements that are for this enhancement. The Tech requirement
  determines the technology level an empire must have before this enhancement
  becomes visible to be used in designs.

Tech Area Req X:    (Optional)
  For each of the Tech Requirements, this is the tech area of the requirement.
  The X is the number of the requirement.
  Allowable values for Tech Area Req:
    A name from the TechArea.txt file.
