The GameSetups folder contains predefined game setup configurations for FrEee.
By default, the game includes one game setup file, Quickstart.gsu, which is used for quick single-player games.
Players can create and save their own custom game setups in this folder, allowing them to quickly start new games with their preferred settings, or share setups of games they are hosting with their players.
To create a new game setup, players can configure the desired game options in the game's setup menu and then save the configuration to this folder instead of actually starting the game.
