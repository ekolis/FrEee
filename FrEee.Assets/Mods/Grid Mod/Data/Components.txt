General Group:
  The General Group this component belongs to. This is used in the
  Add Design Window to only show components of a given group.

Family:
  The family grouping of this component. This is used to determine which components
  can be removed when showing only the latest component of type. This can be
  any number as long as all components with the same name and a different
  Roman Numeral have the same family number.

Roman Numeral:
  The number that follows a component and is displayed as a roman numeral. This is
  a regular number of 0 - 20 which is used to describe components that are
  improved version of an earlier model. This number should be the value of the
  Roman Numeral which follows the name of the component. A value of zero means
  that there is no roman numeral for this component.
