VEHICLE SIZE DATA FILE
=======================================================================================

Bitmap Name:
  This is a bitmap name for the picture which represents this vehicle.
  This is usually the same as the name but with no spaces. This name
  is used as the very last section of the full bitmap name.
  A Vehicle Bitmap is normally named 
  [Empire Name]_[Portrait/Mini]_[Bitmap Name].bmp
  The Empire Name is your empire name.
  Portrait or Mini is the type of the picture. Portrait are 128x128 and
  in an isometric view. Mini are the top-down 36x36 tiles used in space.
  

Vehicle Type:
  Ship, Base, Fighter, Satellite, Mine, Troop, Weapon Platform, Drone

All Units: 
  May not carry cargo (unless a drone).
  May be stored in ships or on planets.
  May be transferred between ships or planets as cargo.

Fighter:
  Stored in Fighter Bays or on a planet. 
  Can be launched into space and moves/refuels just like a ship.
  Can be recovered by a ship with Fighter Bays or a planet.
  They can be self-destructed or fired upon.
  Moves like a ship.
  May or may not have the ability to warp through warp points.
  Once fuel is exhausted, it is destroyed. 
  Completely under player control.

Satellite:
  Stored in Cargo Bays or on a planet.
  Can be deposited in space by a ship or planet.
  Can be recovered by a ship or planet. 
  They can be self-destructed (under player control) or fired upon.
  Cannot move.
  Must be refueled by outside means.
  Once fuel is exhausted, it goes dormant like a ship.
  May or may not be under Player control (depends on components).
  If not under player control, will fire on any ships in the same sector.

Mine:
  Stored in Mine Storage or on a planet.
  Can be deposited in space by a ship or planet.
  Cannot be recovered. 
  They can be self-destructed (under player control) or fired upon.
  Cannot move.
  Minimal fuel required. Even if fuel exhausted, non-fuel using comps still function.
  Requires some type of explosive\warhead component.
  Attempts to detonate when objects enter the sector. 
  May or may not be under Player control (depends on components).
  Depending on components - may be triggered by any ship, ships without certain comp, enemy ships, etc.
    
Troop:
  Stored in Troop Quarters or on a planet.
  Cannot be deposited in space.
  Can be dropped on enemy planets to begin ground combat.
  Cannot move.
  May or may not be under Player control (Monster Troops will fight all comers once dropped).

Weapon Platform:
  Stored in Cargo Bays or on a planet.
  Cannot be deposited in space.
  Cannot move.
  Always under Player control.
  Serve only as a container for weapons which fire from a planet into space (or for ground combat).

Drone:
  Stored in Cargo Bays or on a planet. 
  Can be launched into space from a ship or planet.
  Cannot be recovered. 
  They can be self-destructed (under player control) or fired upon.
  Moves like a ship.
  May or may not have the ability to warp through warp points.
  Once fuel is exhausted, it is destroyed. 
  May or may not be under Player control (depends on components).


[The following items are only used for Units (Fighter, Satellite, Mine, Troop, Weapon Platform, Drone)]

Launched from Ship:
  This unit can be launched into space by a ship. Only applies to units that can 
  actually be launched.

Launched from Planet:
  This unit can be launched into space from a planet. Only applies to units that can 
  actually be launched.
