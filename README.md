FrEee is an open-source 4X game designed to be an enhanced remake of Malfador Machinations' Space Empires IV.

The name comes, of course, from the fact that the game is open-source, and from the Eee, a race of friendly floating space blobs that will not hesitate to backstab you in SE4!

How do you pronounce it? Let me count the ways!
- Freeeeee!
- Free Eee
- Furry
